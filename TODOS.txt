*********
CC table:
Add column "strike", and let "call contract" just be a string
(so one can filter the contract name directly)

**********
where does a strategy have a specified yield? <-- Done.

Also use it in CC. Right now it's implemented in JS:
return `${dollarFmt.format(value)}\n(${percentFmt.format(value / spotPrice - 1.0)})`;

**********

Covered calls, extra data points:
 - probability of profit
 - probability of underperforming spot hodling

How? This relies on VerticalSpreads.
Maybe combine all strategies in a single structure? (e.g. indexed by strike).
Or: create an accumulating distribution of probabilities (per expiration).
Maybe embed it in Oracle.

******
ShortPut - CoveredCall? Show the difference?

******

Covered Call   AND long call? This is the full spectrum.

******


Some utility where you "create the options table":
expiry ->
  future [for index price and interest]
  strikes ->
    1 call, 1 put

You almost did this for VerticalSpread, but didn't add futures yet.
If you can't find a future, you can seamlessly add a synthetic future! Via the best (least slippage) strike.

*********

Position operator+(double or Position?)
maybe safer with Position: always check you don't mix apples with oranges.
operator/ is already implemented like that.

****************
Plot probabilities for all expirations simultaneously? Like cone?

*********************
Charts should be easier for mobile (larger points, for clicking)

*********************

Reusable parts of charts

*********************

Take slippage as parameter

**********************

 * all over/under (touch/don't touch)[]
 * all box spreads (or the best per expiration)
 * probabilities of touch by date

 * Translate all options to RELATIVE:
 * not strikes but moves (%). Not dates but days.
 * Especially for touch probabilities, so they can be screenshot and compared.
