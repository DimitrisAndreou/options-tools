A Position.... is an asset?! Would simplify a lot! But careful!
No, if position was an asset, you could pass a position
for an asset, and then wonder why the size got ignored...

Asset is a position! A position of size 1.
You can always pass an Asset anywhere a position is needed
(it would mean: size = 1).

Then, you should remove method Asset.position().
One could just multiply asset:
asset * size (and get a new position).

Asset is Position
Commodity is Asset
DatedFuture is Asset
Option is asset
SyntheticAsset is Asset

****************
Position operator+(double or Position?)
maybe safer with Position: always check you don't mix apples with oranges.
operator/ is already implemented like that.

****************
Plot probabilities for all expirations simultaneously? Like cone?

*********************
Charts should be easier for mobile (larger points, for clicking)

*********************

Reusable parts of charts

*********************

Take slippage as parameter

**********************

 * all over/under (touch/don't touch)[]
 * all box spreads (or the best per expiration)
 * probabilities of touch by date

 * Translate all options to RELATIVE:
 * not strikes but moves (%). Not dates but days.
 * Especially for touch probabilities, so they can be screenshot and compared.
