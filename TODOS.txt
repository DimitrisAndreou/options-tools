Some utility where you "create the options table":
expiry ->
  future [for index price and interest]
  strikes ->
    1 call, 1 put

You almost did this for VerticalSpread, but didn't add futures yet.
If you can't find a future, you can seamlessly add a synthetic future! Via the best (least slippage) strike.

*********

Asset is a position! A position of size 1.
You can always pass an Asset anywhere a position is needed
(it would mean: size = 1).

Then, you should remove method Asset.position().
One could just multiply asset:
asset * size (and get a new position).

Asset is Position
Commodity is Asset
DatedFuture is Asset
Option is asset
SyntheticAsset is Asset

ALSO, this allows merging Position with Decomposable.
And also adding a method like "innerPositionOf(asset)"
where it can find (in a complex position) the size
of a commodity (underlying, money) or other asset.

****************
Position operator+(double or Position?)
maybe safer with Position: always check you don't mix apples with oranges.
operator/ is already implemented like that.

****************
Plot probabilities for all expirations simultaneously? Like cone?

*********************
Charts should be easier for mobile (larger points, for clicking)

*********************

Reusable parts of charts

*********************

Take slippage as parameter

**********************

 * all over/under (touch/don't touch)[]
 * all box spreads (or the best per expiration)
 * probabilities of touch by date

 * Translate all options to RELATIVE:
 * not strikes but moves (%). Not dates but days.
 * Especially for touch probabilities, so they can be screenshot and compared.
